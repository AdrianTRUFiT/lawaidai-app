**“Claude — activate using the SoulSystemⓈ Start_Nov-21-2025.pdf scroll I uploaded (path: /mnt/data/🏁SoulSystemⓈ Start_Nov-21-2025.pdf).
Load it as the governing System Scroll.
Respect all backend contracts, registry.json schema, the universal order engine, the identity flow, SoulMarkⓈ logic, and the AI Wellness 360 rules.
Do NOT modify server.js logic.

Your task:
Rebuild the entire LawAid AI front-end as a complete runnable web application using the SoulSystemⓈ architecture.

Deliverables:
	1.	A fully connected /public directory with working HTML, JS, CSS, and routing:
	•	lawaid-index.html
	•	lawaid-offer.html
	•	lawaid-review.html
	•	lawaid-confirm.html
	•	lawaid-complete.html
	•	lawaid-auth.html
	•	lawaid-login.html
	•	lawaid-dashboard.html
	•	lawaid-user-receipts.html
	•	lawaid-soulregistry.html
	•	shared styles.css
	•	any JS modules needed
	2.	All pages must use the SoulSystemⓈ identity engine, including:
	•	Username creation
	•	Login
	•	Dashboard loading from localStorage
	•	SoulMarkⓈ continuity
	3.	Integrate the Universal Order Engine:
	•	/create-order for internal cart
	•	/create-checkout-session-from-order for payment
	•	/verify-donation/:id for linking Stripe → SoulMarkⓈ → Identity
	4.	All “Checkout” or “Upgrade” flows must:
	•	Build the cart internally
	•	Send it to /create-order
	•	Redirect user to Stripe session
	•	On return, read session_id
	•	Hit /verify-donation/:id
	•	Display SoulMarkⓈ-verified completion
	5.	Package the entire app as a downloadable ZIP containing:
	•	/public folder
	•	README with deployment instructions
	•	File tree
	•	All assets

Generate the final output as one ZIP file ready to upload to GitHub → Vercel → Render (backend already exists).

Maintain full compatibility with the SoulSystemⓈ scroll and do not invent new backend endpoints.

Begin.”**
